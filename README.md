# AI-CLR

## Implementation of "Harnessing language models for computational literature review of emerging AI topics"
This is an official source code for implementing AI-CLR.


### Computational literature review approach
1) Data collection and pre-processing
2) Development of an AI landscape
3) Assessment of the emergingness of AI topics
4) Construction of an interactive topic evolution map

### Dataset
- We employed public dataset provided by PapersWithCode ([LINK](https://paperswithcode.com/about)).

### Code
- Codes will be available soon!
